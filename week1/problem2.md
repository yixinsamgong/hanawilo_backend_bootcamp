you can use "let", "const" and "var" to declare a variable.
differences: 
    1. var can be hoisted, while let and const cannot(define a variable before its declaration).
    2. var can declare the same variable multiple time, but let and const cannot.
    3. var and let are used to declare variable, and const is used to declare constant.
