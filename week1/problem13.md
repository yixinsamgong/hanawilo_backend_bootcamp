A promise is an an asynchronous action and allows for handling of its success or failure. It can represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. 
    - Pending means the operation is ongoing.
    - Fulfilled means it completed successfully and returned a value. 
    - Rejected means it failed and returned an error. 
Once a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, it becomes settled and its state cannot change.
